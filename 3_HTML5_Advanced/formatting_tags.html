    <p><mark><ins>Lorem Ipsum</ins></mark> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <mark><ins>Lorem Ipsum</ins></mark> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <del>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <mark>Lorem Ipsum</mark> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <mark>Lorem Ipsum</mark>.</del></p>
